# Overview

{For this project I am trying to learn how to use Java by starting with the basics such as Hello World.}

{The software I created for this Java project was to allow the user to display Hello World by using some basic Java code.}

{The purpose I had in mind for creating this software was to learn how to use Java at a very basic level to accomplish displaying Hello World in the console of VS Code.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
